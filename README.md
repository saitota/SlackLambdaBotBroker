# 🚦 Slack Lambda Bot Broker
## Description
Finally, I reached the integration limit of Slack Apps, and I could not add more Lambda-Bot, so I made It. 
This application subscribers every event and distributes to call other Lambda functions as a Message broker.

## Requirement
- AWS Account
- Serverless Framework
- [serverless-plugin-aws-alerts](https://serverless.com/blog/serverless-ops-metrics/) (optional)
- Slack Account

## Installation
To know Scope and Events to subscribe, See my other Bots repo.
